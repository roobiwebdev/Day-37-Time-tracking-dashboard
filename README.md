Day 37 of #100DaysChallenge

Good morning, everyone ☀️ 
Today’s project is an exciting.

Project Name: Time Tracking Dashboard

This dashboard helps users keep track of time spent on various activities like work, play, study, exercise, social, and self-care. Users can toggle between daily, weekly, and monthly views to see how their time is distributed.

Technologies Used
#HTML

#CSS

#JavaScript

HTML Structure
The HTML file sets up the layout with different sections for profile info, activity cards, and time toggles. Semantic elements like <div>, <img>, <h1>, and <ul> are used for structure and presentation.

CSS Styling
Font Import: I've Used Google Fonts to import the "Rubik" font for a modern and consistent look.

Global Styles: Resets default padding and margin, sets box-sizing, and specifies the font-family for consistency.

Layout: Uses CSS Grid for the card layout and Flexbox for centering elements. The design includes a clean and vibrant color palette, rounded corners, and a responsive layout.

Interactive Styles: Adds hover effects and active states for a more engaging user experience.

Hover Effects: Enhances user interaction by changing styles on hover.

JavaScript Functionality
Period Toggle: Adds event listeners to toggle between daily, weekly, and monthly views.

Dynamic Data Display: Updates the time displayed for each activity based on the selected period.
like Daily, Weekly and Monthly.
